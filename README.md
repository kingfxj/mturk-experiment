# Python Virtual Environment
We are going to use a python virtual environment to avoid dependency problems.
## To install dependencies from requirements.txt
### First, activate virtualenv (assuming venv is the name of your virtual environment) 
Linux/Mac: ```source venv/bin/activate```<br>
Windows ```./venv/Scripts/activate```
### Then, install dependencies from requirements.txt
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This should install all dependencies currently needed for the project.
