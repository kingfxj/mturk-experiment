# Python Virtual Environment
We are going to use a python virtual environment to avoid dependency problems.
## *To install dependencies from requirements.txt*
**First, activate virtualenv (assuming venv is the name of your virtual environment)**<br>
Linux/Mac: ```source venv/bin/activate```<br>
Windows: ```./venv/Scripts/activate```<br><br>
**Then, install dependencies from requirements.txt**<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
