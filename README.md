# Python Virtual Environment

We are going to use a python virtual environment to avoid dependency problems.

### _To install dependencies from requirements.txt_

First, create a virtual environment in the root directory of you local repo.<br><br>
Then, activate the virtual environment (assuming venv is the name of your virtual environment):<br>
**Linux/Mac:** `source venv/bin/activate`<br>
**Windows:** `./venv/Scripts/activate`<br><br>
Then, while the venv is active, install dependencies from requirements.txt<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br><br>
After, create `.env` file under `mturksite/mturksite` folder and set the following variables:<br>

        - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        - AWS_REGION_NAME
        - AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
        - HOST

**_Remember to set your editor/IDE to use this virtual environment and have it activated when necessary while developing_**

# PostgreSQL

We are going to use PostgreSQL as a backend database as it is well-suited for production use.<br><br>
To avoid the headache of everyone having to setup local a PostgreSQL server and attempting to keep data synced while developing, we are going to make use of a cloud PostgreSQL server hosted on a Cybera instance. **_WARNING: THIS MEANS THAT ANY DATABASE CHANGES WILL AFFECT EVERYONE._**<br><br>
You will find the connection information for our PostgreSQL server in `mturksite/mturksite/settings.py` in the `DATABASES` dictionary.<br><br>
It is strongly recommended that you install **pgAdmin 4** (https://www.pgadmin.org/) to use as a PostgreSQL management tool. Once installed, make sure you
connect to our Cybera hosted PSQL server using the information found in the settings file above. Remember that you will have to use a VPN tool in order to connect if you do not have IPV6 (see tutorials on eClass).
